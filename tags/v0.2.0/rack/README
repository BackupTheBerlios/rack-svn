The following points are described in this readme:

 1. Starting a simulation example

 2. Starting the JAVA GUI

1. Starting a simulation example
*********************************

You can test RACK without having a real chassis or ladar laser scanner.
The drivers ChassisSim and OdometryChassis, the perception module Scan2DSim
and the navigation module Scan2DSim are needed.

In the direcory 'examples' is the start script of these drivers and
a dxf-map needed by the Scan2D module.

At the time the default dxf-map will be copied while 'make install' into
the Scan2DSim binary directory. If you want to use another map file you have
to copy it into the Scan2DSim directory manually:

    cp your_map_file.dxf <target>/<rack-bin-dir>/perception/map.dxf

Before executing the load script you must adapt the rack binary directory in
the script 'load_rack_sim'.

After changing the dxf-map file and manipulating the load script you can
start the modules:

    sh <target>/<rack-example-dir>/load_rack_sim

*********************************
 2. Starting the JAVA GUI
*********************************

If you enable JAVA-Build in the RACK configure process (look @ INSTALL)
all java files will be compiled and a jar archive of rack will be created in
<rack-install-dir>/gui.

A default gui config file is in the directory <rack-install-dir>/gui, too.
In the config file (e.g. gui.cfg) you can add or remove driver components,
set the message router and add additional jar files or classpaths
(a small howto is directly in the file).

You can start the JAVA GUI with following command:

    java -jar rack.jar <gui-config-file>

    or

    java -jar rack.jar  (here a little file dialog will ask for the gui config file)

That's all.
