* RACK INSTALLATION HOWTO
********************************************************************************

This installation howto is divided into following steps:
 1. configuration
 2. building
 3. installation
 
************************
 1. Configuration
************************

To configure RACK in the source tree you have to do a

    make menuconfig,
    make oldconfig or
    make xconfig

in the RACK source root directory.

To build RACK without polluting the source tree you can build
RACK in a separate build directory:

    cd <your-rack-build-dir>
    make -f <rack-source-dir>/makefile [m|x|old]config

-----------------
1.1 Build options
------------------
Here you can select your RACK installation path,
the linux kernel source directory and
the installation directory of the realtime extension xenomai.
You get the linux and xenomai sources here:
Linux kernel -> www.kernel.org
Xenomai      -> www.xenomai.org

Additionally you can enable java building (for Java-GUI).
You need the java compiler (javac) and jar to compile the java sources.

The Doxygen API is still under construction.

-----------
1.2 Drivers
-----------
All implemented drivers are in this section.
Some special drivers need additional libraries or realtime drivers

drivers/LadarIbeo:
    realtime CAN driver (rt_sja1000)    

drivers/CameraDcam:
    firewire libraries (libraw1394, libdc1394)

drivers/CameraJpeg:
    jpeg libraries (libjpeg)

-> Per default the drivers do not need more libraries.

--------------
1.3 Navigation
--------------
The navigation modules can be selected in this menu.
At the time there is a PilotJoystick module which needs a Chassis and an 
optional Scan2D module.

--------------
1.4 Perception
--------------
The Scan2D modules converts Ladar data into a 2D distance map.
To use a Scan2D module without having a real ladar laser scanner, select
the Scan2DSim module. This module needs a dxf-map instead.

--------------
1.5 Main
--------------
Here you can enable the support of additional libraries and drivers.
The path to the directories can be inscribed, too.

--------------

There is a new .rack_config file in your source or build directory now.

************************
 2. Building
************************
To build RACK you only need to execute

    make
    
.
If you are using distcc or icecream you can build RACK with the additional job option

    make -j<number-of-jobs>


************************
 3. Installing
************************

Do a

    make install
    
    
The binaries, modules and libraries are in your RACK install directory 
(set in Kconfig->Build Options->Installation Directory)

That's all ;-)
