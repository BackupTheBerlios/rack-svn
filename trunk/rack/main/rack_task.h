/**
 * @brief Change task mode bits.

 * bits to clear for disabling the corresponding modes, and another
 * one to set for enabling them. The mode bits which were previously
 * in effect can be returned upon request.
 *
 * The following supported bits can be part of the bitmask:
 *
 * - When set, T_WARNSW causes the SIGXCPU signal to be sent to the
 * current user-space task whenever it switches to the secondary
 * mode. This feature is useful to detect unwanted migrations to the
 * Linux domain.
 *
 * - T_PRIMARY can be passed to switch the current user-space task to
 * primary mode (setmask |= T_PRIMARY), or secondary mode (clrmask |=
 * T_PRIMARY). Upon return from rt_task_set_mode(), the user-space
 * task will run into the specified domain.
 *
 * @param clrmask A bitmask of mode bits to clear for the current
 * task, before @a setmask is applied. 0 is an acceptable value which
 * leads to a no-op.
 *
 * @param setmask A bitmask of mode bits to set for the current
 * task. 0 is an acceptable value which leads to a no-op.
 *
 * @param mode_r If non-NULL, @a mode_r must be a pointer to a memory
 * location which will be written upon success with the previous set
 * of active mode bits. If NULL, the previous set of active mode bits
 * will not be returned.
 *
 * @return 0 is returned upon success, or:
 *
 * - -EINVAL if either @a setmask or @a clrmask specifies invalid
 * bits. T_PRIMARY is invalid for kernel-based tasks.
 *
 * - -EPERM is returned if this service was not called from a
 * real-time task context.

 *
 * This service can be called from:
 *
 * - User-space task

 * Rescheduling: possible
