 * Mutex services.
 *
 * A mutex is a MUTual EXclusion object, and is useful for protecting
 * shared data structures from concurrent modifications, and
 * implementing critical sections and monitors.
 *
 * A mutex has two possible states: unlocked (not owned by any task),
 * and locked (owned by one task). A mutex can never be owned by two
 * different tasks simultaneously. A task attempting to lock a mutex
 * that is already locked by another task is blocked until the latter
 * unlocks the mutex first.
 *
 * RACK (Xenomai) mutex services enforce a priority inheritance protocol in
 * order to solve priority inversions.

/**
 * @brief Acquire a mutex.
 *
 * Attempt to lock a mutex. The calling task is blocked until the
 * mutex is available, in which case it is locked again before this
 * service returns. Mutexes have an ownership property, which means
 * that their current owner is tracked. Xenomai mutexes are implicitely
 * recursive and implement the priority inheritance protocol.
 *
 * Since a nested locking count is maintained for the current owner,
 * RackMutex::lock() and RackMutex::unlock() must be used in pairs.
 *
 * Tasks pend on mutexes by priority order.
 *
 * @param timeout The number of nanoseconds to wait for the mutex to
 * be available to the calling task. Passing RACK_INFINITE
 * causes the caller to block indefinitely until the mutex is
 * available. Passing RACK_NONBLOCK causes the service to return
 * immediately without waiting if the mutex is still locked by another
 * task.
 *
 * @return 0 is returned upon success. Otherwise:
 *
 * - -EINVAL is returned if the mutex is not a mutex descriptor
 * (internal error).
 *
 * - -EIDRM is returned if the mutex is a deleted mutex descriptor,
 * including if the deletion occurred while the caller was sleeping on
 * it (internal error).
 *
 * - -EWOULDBLOCK is returned if @a timeout is equal to RACK_NONBLOCK
 * and the mutex is not immediately available.
 *
 * - -EINTR is returned if RackTask::unblock() has been called for the
 * waiting task before the mutex has become available.
 *
 * - -ETIMEDOUT is returned if the mutex cannot be made available to
 * the calling task within the specified amount of time.
 *
 * - -EPERM is returned if this service was called from a context
 * which cannot be given the ownership of the mutex (e.g. interrupt,
 * non-realtime or scheduler locked).
 *
 * Environments:
 *
 * This service can be called from:
 *
 * - User-space task (switches to primary mode)
 *
 * Rescheduling: always unless the request is immediately satisfied or
 * @a timeout specifies a non-blocking operation.  If the caller is
 * blocked, the current owner's priority might be temporarily raised
 * as a consequence of the priority inheritance protocol.
